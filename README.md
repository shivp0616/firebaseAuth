# firebaseAuth
These project will use authentication process using Firebase AuthUI.
The framework that we are using is Bootstrap. For more information you can visit http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/.

This is just a template of how to use firebase to authenticate using email and password and after authenticating, it will show your name and your unique id. If you directly go to the main.html without login, it will redirect you to the login page.

Before using this template, first you have to create a project on Firebase and then paste the api key and other necessary details in the fireBase.js file and then you are good to go.

You are free to use this template but do mention that where you get it from.
The "QR Code Generator" that we are using is taken from https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jquery-qrcode.
